We are the computer science and data science organization at Luther College with over 160 student and faculty members and we are also a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)! 

Throughout the year, we build community around tech and help you navigate your way in Computer Science and Data science at Luther by hosting several discussion oriented events around tech (often with a figure from academia or industry), organizing exciting project / algorithm based hackathons, and providing you with information about the latest university conferences.

If you have any questions about CSS and our missions / goals or would like to get involved with CSS, feel free to reach out to any of us at css@luther.edu.
